<u><h2>Passion</h2></u>
    <p>A definitive word to describe what <b>drives</b> me to excell at school and extra curriculum activites is passion. My strong passion has helped me develope a high level competiveness and winning mentality.
    This has shaped the way i view life and teh challeneges that come with it; i encourage it, with the view that with each challenge, I get better and <strong>better</strong>. This mentality has gotten me through 
    many late nights doing projects and many failed quizes or exams. It has kept me going and striving.  </p>

<center><h4>"<em>I keep my head high, I got my wings to carry me. I don't know freedom, I want my dreams to rescue me.</em>"-Jermaine Cole</J></h4></center>
<br/>
<p>Jermaine Cole aka J.Cole is an American rapper who hails from North Carolina. He became famous through releasign fire mixtapes on the internet and through his passion and persistence gained a label deal with Jay-Z. He made a nae for himself and created his own label "Dreamville" . He has now solidified himslef as one of the greatest to ever do it and continues to pave the way for new artists. I chose J.Cole as my hero because under the definiton a hero is someone that saves people and while not necessarily wearing a cape J.Coles music has helped me get through alot of hard times and has motivated me to keep pursuing my dreams. His show of passion has led him to unparalleled heights and i believe i can follow suit. </p>

<p> I do think the test was accurate. All my life i've been on teh more secluded side. i am able to be outgoing and friendly, but i've always felt more at peace when alone. And i am very meticulous and clean.</p>
